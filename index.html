		<center><p style="font-family: initial; font-size:20px;color: indianred;padding-left: 550px;padding-right: 150px;line-height: 19px;"><b>In the movie "Welcome," the character Sagar, also known as Majnu Bhai, portrayed by actor Anil Kapoor, is humorously depicted as an amateur artist. The painting of the horse with the goat on its back is famously attributed to Majnu Bhai within the film's storyline. This painting is a running joke in the movie, highlighting Majnu Bhai's comically exaggerated self-perception as a talented painter.
		<br><br>
		While the painting itself is a fictional creation within the context of the film, it has become an iconic element associated with the character and the movie's humor. The absurdity and whimsical nature of the painting fit well with the comedic tone of "Welcome," contributing to some of its memorable and light-hearted moments.</b></p></center>

		<center><p style="font-family: initial; font-size:20px;color: darkblue;padding-right: 550px;padding-left: 150px;line-height: 19px;"><b>In "Taare Zameen Par" (2007), the painting symbolizes protagonist Ishaan Awasthi's emotional liberation and unique talents. Displayed during an art competition, the vibrant and joyful portrait reflects Ishaan's journey from struggling with dyslexia to finding confidence through his supportive art teacher, Ram Shankar Nikumbh. The bright colors and dynamic brushstrokes highlight the themes of creativity, individuality, and the importance of nurturing each child's unique abilities.
		<br><br>
		This artwork serves as a metaphor for the film's message that every child is special and their talents should be recognized and encouraged. It underscores the transformative power of understanding and supportive education, emphasizing the value of each child's distinct perspective and potential.</b></p></center>
